## Project description

This Board Game Rental program is designed to provide a sample solution for renting out board games while managing inventory, customers, and financial transactions. It includes a robust storage system for games, categorizing them by genre, age range, and player requirements, as well as a customer management feature to track details like rental history and payment preferences. The program offers a manager control panel to oversee inventory, generate reports, and monitor cash flow, ensuring smooth operations. Additionally, it can print detailed receipts that include rental information, fees, and return instructions, possibly featuring QR codes for digital convenience. To enhance user experience, the program stores game instructions, such as rulebooks or step-by-step guides, and could even provide tutorial videos. With these features, the program aims to streamline the board game rental experience for both customers and managers.
