## Project description
This project aims to create a web application that enables customers to sign up, sign in, and log out securely, providing a seamless user experience. Additionally, it incorporates an admin authorization system, empowering administrators with the ability to manage user profiles. Admins can edit, delete, or oversee members' accounts to ensure efficient and secure operations. These functionalities make the application suitable for membership-based services, e-commerce platforms, or community-driven systems.

We created this website as part of a charity program, and it includes a RUNNING EVENT to collect donations and help others.

## How to compile and run the program

1. **Clone the Code**: Access the project's GitHub repository and clone the code to your local system. You can do this by running:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
    (Please [email me](mailto:mtran@csustudent.net?subject=GitHub%20Access) to request access.)

2. **AWS Deployment**: Set up an AWS account if you don't already have one. You'll need to configure the environment on AWS to deploy your Ruby project. This may involve creating an EC2 instance, setting up the appropriate Ruby runtime, and uploading your code. You might also need to install dependencies using a tool like `Bundler` if the project uses a `Gemfile`.

3. **Register for Fly.io**: Sign up for Fly.io and configure the platform for deployment.
